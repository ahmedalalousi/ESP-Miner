  --body "## Description
This PR finalises the voltage monitoring capabilities with multiple view options for the AxeOS UI.

## Features Added
- **Single Column View**: Original layout with colored ASIC status boxes
- **Multi-Column View**: Chains displayed in responsive grid layout  
- **Collapsible View**: Accordion-style expandable chains
- **Tree View**: Fully hierarchical and comprehensive view now fully functional
- **View control**: now uses PrimeNG segmented button control

## Visual Changes
- ASICs displayed as colored boxes:
  - Green: Healthy (1.1V - 1.4V)
  - Amber: Degraded (0.8V - 1.1V or >1.4V)
  - Red: Fault (<0.8V or invalid)
- Each ASIC shows voltage, frequency, and hash rate
- Real-time updates every 5 seconds

## Implementation Details
- Uses existing voltage monitoring API endpoints
- Integrates with system data for frequency/hashrate
- Saves user's preferred view in localStorage
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Testing
- Tested with mock server (included in `/mock-server`)
- Supports variable number of chains and ASICs
- No hardware required for UI development

## Known Issues
- None

## Related
- Builds on PR #[previous PR number if any]
- Requires voltage monitoring firmware support
